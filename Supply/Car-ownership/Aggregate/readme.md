# Car-ownership estimation

This model is intended to estimate car-ownership at a zonal level. A CSV file of aggregate socio-demographics data at zonal level  is taken as an input and the output is also a CSV file, with car-ownership value combined with the aggregate socio-demographics data. 

# Pre-requisites

This model is coded in 'R' language. For details about R, kindly check https://www.r-project.org. RStudio IDE is suggested (https://www.rstudio.com). This model uses the base functions in R and hence, no special package is required.

# Description of the model files
1.	CoefficientValues.csv – Model coefficients; unless you want to use custom values, do not change the values in the file
2.	AggregateCarOwnershipPrediction.R – Main model script
3.	InputSampleFile.csv – Sample input file, for understanding the inputs and testing the model
