# **Fleet planning**

Matching algorithm that matches drivers with passengers into shared trips. 

# **Pre-requisites**
Python 3.8.8

# **Description of the model files**
* planning_objective.py : This module is on progress. The final form must consider AIMSUN generated data. It contains the methods to compute system costs.
* simulation_outputs.json : That data generated from random samppling and don't reflect the real simulation results. However, the format will be similar. 
 So, it works as an example of how the inputs for objective must be. 
* stop_candidates.py : It takes as an input disaggregated demand of OD trips with timestamp and approximate the best stop candidates. Planner can insert the desired
maximum distance each user must walk to reach a available station. 
* vehicles_size.py: This module solve the VRP to define the fleet size for the operation. The user can choose the maximum route distance and the size of fleet. 
* facility_lication.py : (under developement) choose the optimal subset (set covering) via facility location MIP.
